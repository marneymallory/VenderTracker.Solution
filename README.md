- A text editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- A command line interface like Terminal or GitBash to run and interact with the console app.

### Installation

2. Navigate to the `{Template.Solution}` directory on your computer
3. Open with your preferred text editor to view the code base
4. To run the console app:
   - Navigate to `{Template.Solution/Template}` in your command line
   - Run the command `dotnet restore` to restore the dependencies that are listed in `{Template.csproj}`
   - Run the command `dotnet build` to build the project and its dependencies into a set of binaries
   - Finally, run the command `dotnet run` to run the project!
   - Note: `dotnet run` also restores and builds the project, so you can use this single command to start the console app
